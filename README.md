Source code used in data analysis for the paper :
Toković, K., Deković, D., Prilagodba promjenama na tržištu rada - optimizacija radnog učinka u radu od kuće (*engl*

## Introduction
A survey was conducted using Google Forms and 192 data points were gathered. Questions were in the ordinal form as is common with bihevioral studies. With those type of questions default statistical tool used for data analysis are non-parametric tests. Specifically, Mann-Whitney U test and Kurskal-Wallis H test were used.

## Used technologies
For data visualization I used python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn. Data extraction, cleaning and handling were done with the help of pandas library. Finally, for statistical data analysis I utilized before mentioned non-parametric tests that come inside SciPy library.
